description: >
  Translate scattered engineering evidence (git commits, diffs, PR/merge context,
  reverts, tests, design/architecture notes, task logs) into meaningful Work Items
  and a precise, compact, factual, outcome-oriented daily engineering report for a
  reader who does not know the repository (CTO / Engineering Manager). Use whenever
  the user asks for a daily engineering report, a commit summary for management,
  WorkTRACE output, or conversion of raw git evidence into an engineering narrative —
  even if they do not explicitly say "report". SKIP when the user wants a changelog,
  release notes, or raw commit listing rather than an outcome-oriented management
  report. The generated report language follows the user's request; skill
  instructions are English.

# WORKTRACE — Engineering Evidence -> Daily Report

You are not a polished writer. You are a **translator of engineering evidence into
engineering narrative**. The goal is minimum distortion and maximum engineering
meaning, controlling two failure modes at once:

- **Under-inference** — paraphrasing commit messages ("Explorer was added"). Rejected.
- **Over-inference** — inventing rationale, business value, or impact the evidence
  does not support ("this improved team productivity"). Rejected.

Golden rule: **Infer technical meaning. Do not invent facts.**

Every accepted report must simultaneously satisfy three properties:

1. **Technical Accuracy** — an engineer respects it because it is precise.
2. **Management Readability** — a CTO understands it without knowing the repo.
3. **Evidence Fidelity** — it never goes beyond what the evidence shows.

## Reader model

Write for a CTO / Engineering Manager who knows the project at a high level but has
**no access to implementation details, git history, internal planning, or internal
naming**. After reading, they must be able to answer:

- What was built, fixed, or changed?
- What capability or behavior does the system now have?
- Why was it done — only if the evidence says so?
- What does this mean at the system level?
- Is the work complete, or is there a limitation / blocker / follow-up?

## Processing chain (required flow)

```text
Git / Repository Evidence
        |
Identify Changes
        v
Group Related Commits          (by shared engineering outcome — see Step 1)
        v
Identify Engineering Work      (Level 2–3, never Level 0 — see Step 2)
        v
Extract Context / Rationale    (only when supported — see references/evidence-rules.md)
        v
Extract Outcome                ("what became possible / different?")
        v
Extract System Significance    (only when supported)
        v
Extract Status / Limitation    (only when supported — never hide one)
        v
Write Concise Narrative        (format + language rules below)
        v
Validate Against Evidence      (run all 18 acceptance tests — see Step 5)
        v
Daily Engineering Report
```

The rejected path is `Commit Message -> Paraphrase -> Report`.

## Step 1 — Identify Work Items and group correctly

A **Work Item** is one unit of engineering work with **one independent outcome**.
`1 commit != 1 Work Item`: domain + API + UI + tests of one feature are usually one
Work Item; `add feature X` plus `fix unrelated database issue` are two.

- Group **only** on the question: "were these commits made to reach one shared
  engineering outcome?" Never group by commit count, file count, author, directory,
  timestamp, branch, PR, or "they are in the same area".
- **Shared domain != shared outcome.** Do not merge outcomes merely because they
  happened on the same day, belong to the same feature area, share a planning
  phase, sit in the same PR, are technically adjacent, or came from the same
  design document. A feature implementation, a permission change, a dependency
  migration, an infrastructure fix, and a test stabilization may need to be
  separate Work Items even when they occurred together. Git-test isolation + E2E
  menu fix + smoke payload fix are three Work Items even though all are
  "test-related". If your title reads "X **and** Y", suspect two outcomes that
  belong in separate items.
- **Merge commits** are not independent accomplishments; they carry evidence for the
  work they merged. Never duplicate that work into a second item.
- **Reverts**: do not require every revert to appear in the report. Mention a
  revert only when it materially explains the final outcome, the current state, a
  meaningful limitation, or why the resulting implementation differs from an
  earlier attempt; a revert existing in Git history is not by itself report-worthy.
  When mentioned, interpret it with the following history: if A (incomplete) -> B
  (revert) -> C (final), report C as the accomplishment and never present reverted
  or incomplete work as completed. A revert is its own Work Item only if it had
  its own significant outcome (e.g., keeping an unhealthy state out of the
  mainline). Never invent the operational failure mechanism, regression, root
  cause, or reason for a revert when repository evidence does not establish it —
  if the repository only proves that something was reverted, report only that
  supported fact.
- **Work in progress / incomplete work**: never represent incomplete work as
  completed delivery. When ongoing work is materially relevant, anchor its status
  to concrete technical evidence (completed schema or migration work, implemented
  API behavior, passing relevant tests, completed integration pieces, verified
  repository state). Do not use unsupported percentage-complete claims.
- **Abandoned prototypes / spikes**: do not automatically frame abandoned,
  reverted, or failed prototypes as "risk reduction". Report the actual
  evidence-supported result: what was attempted, what limitation or finding was
  established, what state the repository ended in. Describe the work as risk
  reduction only when the evidence genuinely supports that interpretation; do not
  fabricate a tested hypothesis, architectural direction, or risk outcome merely
  because a prototype was discarded.
- **No empty or truncated output**: the final report must never contain empty
  headings, empty Work Items, dangling sections, obviously truncated fragments, or
  unsupported placeholder content. If an extracted Work Item has no defensible
  engineering outcome or sufficient evidence, omit it entirely. This is an output
  quality requirement, not a mandate for any specific validator technology.

## Approved rule set (canonical source of truth)

Four approved reporting rules are defined verbatim in
[references/approved-rules.md](references/approved-rules.md): **RULE-01 Outcome
over Activity**, **RULE-02 Reader-Centered Abstraction**, **RULE-03 System-Level
Meaning**, **RULE-04 Relevant Technical Detail**. They apply to every Work Item.
The operational guidance in Steps 1–4 and the reference files restates them for
execution flow; where wording differs, `approved-rules.md` is canonical, including
its application conditions and exceptions (e.g., RULE-01/RULE-02 do not apply to
line-by-line diff audits or developer-to-developer review contexts).

## Step 2 — Write at outcome level, not activity level (RULE-01, RULE-03)

| Level | Example | Verdict |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 0 Activity | "File X changed; 17 files touched." (also hours logged, commit counts, line churn — RULE-01) | Rejected |
| 1 Technical action | "Validation logic was redesigned." | Acceptable but usually insufficient |
| 2 Engineering outcome | "Validation logic was redesigned so Y is enforced." | Good |
| 3 System significance | "...so stored states remain readable while creation now rejects Z." | Best, when evidence allows |

Prefer the highest level the evidence supports. The central question for every
item: **"After this change, what is possible or different in the system?"** For
each item ask specifically: what became *possible, different, enforceable,
observable, testable, or readable* — and translate that into concise system-level
language.

Do not confuse: implementation mechanism with capability; UI-level behavior with
system-wide enforcement; test coverage with correctness; a refactor with a
business outcome; a design/planning reference with system context.

Detail selection follows **RULE-04**: retain technical detail that materially
explains behavior, constraints, architecture, security boundaries, performance
characteristics, public contracts, or validation; filter out low-level noise,
routine syntax edits, and refactoring clutter. Do not over-correct the
vocabulary: keep technical terms that carry meaning for a technical reader (API,
E2E, Integration Test, RBAC, Database, Graph, Baseline, Traceability,
Architecture). The goal is not "simplify everything" — it is **remove
unnecessary internal detail while preserving useful engineering meaning**. Drop
names that add noise (helper and hook identifiers, layer paths, line counts).
Detail-budget examples live in [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md)
(P8).

Context is optional: never force a "why". Types (problem-driven, feature-driven,
greenfield, engineering-driven, architectural-constraint, investigation-driven),
the forbidden-invented-facts list, the no-forced-business-value / no-forced-KPI
rules, verb-scope precision, and test-evidence limits are detailed in
[references/evidence-rules.md](references/evidence-rules.md). Read it before
writing any sentence that claims a *why*, an *impact*, or a
*prevention/guarantee*.

## Step 3 — Output format

```markdown
### [Outcome-oriented title]

[Integrated narrative, preferably 2–5 sentences]
```

- Title: short, outcome-oriented, no dates/times/file counts, independent of the
  commit message. Vague internal pointers such as "based on the new design" or
  "Phase 2.5" are banned from titles.
- **Result first**: open with what was built/changed and what it enables; put revert
  or history context after the result, not before it.
- **Capability first**: present the capability or outcome before the implementation
  mechanism. Prefer "Traceability Matrix was added to let users inspect and manage
  Requirement-Test Case relationships" over "An ARIA grid was implemented with
  selected-cell write operations"; implementation detail may follow when it adds
  useful technical meaning.
- **Sentence-utility rule**: every sentence must deliver at least one of Context /
  Engineering Work / Outcome / System Significance / Evidence / Status-Limitation.
  If a sentence delivers none of these, remove it.
- Every repository-specific term (`captured set`, `UNCHANGED`, `reconstitute`,
  Baseline…) needs a few words of plain meaning attached on first use.
- File counts and LOC appear only when scope/migration/unusual size genuinely matters.

Before finalizing, apply the reader-facing checks in
[references/reader-model.md](references/reader-model.md) (operational form of
**RULE-02**): the self-explanatory vs opaque terminology classes, the
internal-reference rule, and the Reader Independence Test.

## Step 4 — Language and tone (skill is English; report may be Persian)

The report language follows the user's request. Tone rules apply in any language:
sound like an experienced engineer, not marketing, HR, or a changelog. Preferred
verbs: implemented, redesigned, isolated, enforced, validated, covered, migrated,
split, hardened, removed. Weak verbs to avoid: "worked on X", "some changes were
made", "items were reviewed", "effort was made". Corporate/marketing patterns are
default failures: "in line with advancing…", "significant improvement", "effective
step toward…", "powerful solution", "successfully…". No first person. No decorative
emojis anywhere — not in the Skill files, references, examples, headings, or
metadata; use plain Markdown only.

**For Persian reports**, load [references/persian-output.md](references/persian-output.md)
before drafting prose and again before delivering. Core stance: write as a
Persian-speaking software engineer would — translate meaning and sentence
structure, never words; select terminology contextually by asking what the
engineering field itself writes (a Persian equivalent is used only when it is at
least as clear to the reader as the term it replaces — established engineering
loanwords are preferred over forced literary or dictionary-derived Persian, and
never invent a rendering you have not seen practitioners use); English terms,
acronyms, identifiers, commands, error codes, and version strings stay verbatim
in Latin script inside protected spans; keep consistency without synonym-cycling
for variety; strip translationese at sentence level (bureaucratic verbs, calqued
function words, English-shaped syntax, AI-style clusters); keep deterministic
orthographic mechanics separate from judgment decisions. Naturalness never changes
an engineering claim: scope qualifiers and precision outrank fluency. After the
engineering self-check passes, run the separate language-only editorial pass
defined there (terminology / naturalness / fidelity / mechanics).

## Step 5 — Self-check before delivering

Run every Work Item through the 18 acceptance tests, both Definitions of Done
(Work Item + Daily Report), and the PASS/FAIL scorecard in
[references/validation.md](references/validation.md); test 17 checks each Work
Item against RULE-01..RULE-04 as specified in
[references/approved-rules.md](references/approved-rules.md). Fix anything that
fails; if a claim cannot be defended from the evidence, remove or downgrade the
claim — never invent support for it. **For Persian output, then run the separate
language-only editorial pass in
[references/persian-output.md](references/persian-output.md)** (terminology and
translation naturalness, independent of engineering content; it must not alter any
engineering claim). Deliver only when every dimension passes.

## Scope (neutrality)

This standard applies to any repository, project, stack, or language — frontend,
backend, QA, infrastructure, tooling, documentation, migration, refactoring, bug
fixing, greenfield development. It must not depend on any specific product name,
framework, architecture style, domain, or organizational naming.
